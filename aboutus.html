<h1>we are selling new and old model cars</h1>
<p>Indian automotive industry is growing rapidly with more and more players entering the space
     while some making their roots stronger. But there was a time when all this was still a decade away. 
     There were companies like Hindustan Motors and Premier that were trying to compete with the likes of Maruti Suzuki for the supremacy
      in the market. During this period, companies launched some cars that are still renowned for various factors. Let us take a look at the iconic cars
     from the 1990s that can be credited with moulding the path for the current industry.</p>
     <h1>Premier Padmini</h1>
     <img src="./premierpadmini.webp" width="50%" height="300px"><br>
     <button>bookknow</button>
     <p>Fiat 1100D or the Padmini was launched back in 1964 by Premier to rival the HM Ambassador. The saloon became popular among the Indian
         masses due to efficiency and ease to drive. 
        It became a hit amongst youngsters, celebrities, gents, ladies and indeed everybody. While the century approached towards the end, 
        Padmini also started to face stiff competition from the competitors. 
        India’s most loved family car can still be seen plying on the roads of Mumbai as taxis.</p>
        <h1>Premier 118NE</h1>
        <img src="./premier118.webp"width="50%" height="300px" ><br>
        <button>bookknow</button>
        <p>This saloon from Premier was not able to live up to the name that Padmini had built.
             But that does not mean the car was not good enough. It had the best engine option at that time with the best possible transmission at its disposal. But the long wait period and non-availability 
            of parts made the car’s demand fade off slowly. When it was launched in 1985, </p>
            <h1>Maruti Suzuki 800</h1>
            <img src="./maruti800.webp" width="50%" height="300px" ><br>
            <button>bookknow</button>
            <p>Another longest-running production car on the list, although not much when compared to the Amby. Maruti Udyog Ltd. started back in 1983 with the launch of their first car, the Maruti 800
                . This car gave its rivals sleepless nights and remained the best selling car in India for more than 2 decades. The 1990s saw an increase 
                in demand for cars, which directly meant an increase in demand of the 800.</p>
                <h1>Ford Ikon</h1>
                <img src="./fordikon.webp" width="50%" height="300px"><br>
                <button>bookknow</button>
                <p>Speaking of iconic cars, how can we miss the josh machine from Ford, the Ikon itself. It was launched in the second last year of the decade, i.e. 1999. The car was powered by a 1.3-litre SOHC petrol engine which produced nearly 70hp of power and a peak torque of 100Nm. 
                    A 5-speed manual transmission was offered with the engine. The car was pretty equipped at that time. It had power steering, power windows, air conditioner, anti-theft alarm, child safety locks, central locking, power door locks,
                    day and night rear-view mirror and so on. It ran for a decade before getting benched.</p>
